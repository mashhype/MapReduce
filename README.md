# MapReduce
Source code for a few class assignments that demonstrates how to write a basic Map Reduce program.  
This is a console based app.  Note that you will need to install all the libraries to run the programs.
In addition, the MapReduceAdvanced program is incomplete.  The goal was to demonstrate how you can use multiple 
mappers/reducers.
